### Description

This is a very nice Lunar Lander game made with vb. It uses sine and cosine to rotate your ship. This game works smoothly on the computers that I have used it on. This program uses DirectX7 to change the screen resolution. I have changed the code so that it is now well commented and a bit easier to play. Please leave a vote and comments and tell me if there are any ways that I can make this game better.
